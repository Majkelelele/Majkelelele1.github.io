## Short Info


The Swift messaging network is a component of the global payments system.[3] Swift acts as a carrier of the "messages containing the payment instructions between financial institutions involved in a transaction".[4][5] However, the organisation does not manage accounts on behalf of individuals or financial institutions, and it does not hold funds from third parties.[6] It also does not perform clearing or settlement functions.[7][5] After a payment has been initiated, it must be settled through a payment system, such as TARGET2 in Europe.[8] In the context of cross-border transactions, this step often takes place through correspondent banking accounts that financial institutions have with each other.[4]
